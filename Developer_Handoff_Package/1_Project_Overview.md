# CareSupport iOS: Project Overview

**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-17  

## App Purpose & Vision

CareSupport is an emotionally intelligent mobile platform designed to transform the caregiving experience by connecting all stakeholders in a care situation. The app serves as a central hub where caregivers, care recipients, organizers, and supporters can coordinate care activities, communicate effectively, and manage tasks in a way that respects each user's role, relationship, and emotional needs.

Our vision is to reduce caregiver burnout, increase care recipient autonomy, and improve coordination among everyone involved in a care circle through technology that adapts to each user's role while maintaining a cohesive experience.

### Key Differentiators

- **Emotionally Intelligent Interactions**: The platform acknowledges the emotional aspects of caregiving through supportive interactions and adaptive interfaces.
- **Role-Adaptive Interface**: A single app that presents different features and content based on the user's role, eliminating the need for separate apps.
- **Privacy-Centric Design**: Built-in privacy controls that respect boundaries while enabling necessary coordination.
- **Care Circle Structure**: Organized around the concept of care circles to facilitate natural relationship structures.
