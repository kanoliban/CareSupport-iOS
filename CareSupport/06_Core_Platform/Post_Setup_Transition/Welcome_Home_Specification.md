### A5.2 API Requirements

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|

## 6. Edge Cases & Error States

| Scenario | System Behavior | User Feedback |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| User exits app before completing welcome | Remember progress, resume on next login | "Welcome back! Let's pick up where you left off." |
| User has multiple incomplete setup items | Prioritize based on importance, show one at a time | Show most critical item first with option to see all |
| User completes all setup items during welcome | Update UI to reflect completion, offer new actions | "Everything's set! Here's what you can do next." |
| User has multiple roles | Present welcome for primary role, indicate other roles | Primary role welcome with option to switch roles |
| System can't load personalized content | Fall back to role-based defaults | Generic welcome with error handled gracefully |
| User explicitly skips welcome | Mark as seen, proceed to dashboard | No further welcome prompts unless requested |

## 7. Accessibility Considerations

- All welcome text meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- Welcome overlay is fully keyboard navigable with logical tab order
- Screen readers announce welcome content with proper heading structure
- Guided tour tooltips have ARIA labels and are keyboard accessible
- Animations respect "Reduce Motion" settings
- Quick win opportunities have clear success states visible without color dependency
- All interactive elements have minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Content prioritizes clarity over density for readability

## 8. Implementation Notes

### 8.1 Technical Approach

- Welcome overlay and guided tour use shared component library
- Personalization driven by data from onboarding and setup phases
- Role adaptations implemented through component props, not separate components
- Analytics track engagement with welcome components
- Tour state persisted across sessions
- Progressive enhancement for slower connections

### 8.2 Phasing

Phase 1 (MVP):
- Basic welcome overlay with role-specific content
- Dashboard with first-time elements
- Incomplete setup indicators
- Quick win opportunities

Phase 2:
- Enhanced guided tour
- Deeper personalization
- Improved analytics
- Additional quick win types

### 8.3 Integration Dependencies

- Requires completed onboarding and setup data models
- Depends on unified dashboard framework
- Needs role-based permission system
- Requires access to setup completion state

## 9. Success Metrics

- 95% of users complete welcome experience
- 80% engage with at least one suggested action
- 70% opt for guided tour if offered
- 50% complete a quick win action during first session
- <5% exit app during welcome without completing
- Caregiver retention: 85% return within 24 hours
