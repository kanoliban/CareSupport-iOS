# CareSupport Core Platform
**Production-Ready Documentation & Development Guide**

## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for CareSupport's unified core platform development. Following role-specific onboarding and care plan setup, this documentation guides the implementation of the main application experience - the central hub for caregiving coordination, communication, and support.

### 1.1 Project Context

CareSupport is an emotionally intelligent platform that connects caregivers, care recipients, organizers, and supporters in a coordinated care experience. The platform has been designed with:

- Role-specific onboarding flows that establish identity and context
- Care plan setup processes that capture preferences and needs
- A unified, role-adaptive application experience (this development phase)

### 1.2 Development Approach

We're implementing a unified platform approach where:
- All roles share the same component system and layout framework
- Content, functionality, and permissions adapt based on role
- Interactions maintain consistency while respecting role-specific needs

| **Task** | A discrete care activity that can be assigned, tracked, and completed | Core object in the coordination system |
| **Journal** | Personal or shared record of observations, reflections, and care notes | Feature for documentation and reflection |
| **Care Recipient** | The person receiving care | Used instead of "patient" or other clinical terms |
| **Caregiver** | Primary person coordinating or providing hands-on care | Distinguished from other supporting roles |
| **Organizer** | Person who manages logistics and coordination | Focuses on system and schedule |
| **Supporter** | Person providing occasional or specific help | Limited, focused engagement |
| **Daily Rhythm** | The general pattern of a care recipient's day | Used for scheduling and expectations |
| **Care Situation** | The overall health context and care needs | Provides framework for care approach |
| **Check-in** | Brief status update or wellness verification | Used for monitoring and connection |
| **Primary Challenge** | Most pressing caregiving difficulty identified during setup | Drives personalization and recommendations |

## 6. Getting Started

### 6.1 Development Priorities

1. **Post-Setup Transition Experience** - Critical handoff from setup to active usage
2. **Core Navigation Framework** - Unified system that adapts to roles
3. **Shared Component System** - Adaptive components with role states
4. **Task Management System** - Foundation for care coordination
5. **Communication Hub** - Connected messaging and updates
6. **Care Recipient Status** - Health tracking and monitoring

### 6.2 Key Development Principles

1. **Role-Adaptive, Not Role-Specific** - Build one system that adapts, not separate systems
2. **Emotional Intelligence** - Maintain EI principles from the Constitution document
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show what's needed when it's needed
4. **Accessibility First** - Follow standards from `accessibility.md`
5. **Data Continuity** - Leverage data from onboarding and setup phases
