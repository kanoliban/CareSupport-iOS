## Implementation Tips

### How to Navigate System Complexity
1. **Start with vertical slices:** Implement one complete feature through all layers.
2. **Role by role approach:** Complete one role before moving to the next.
3. **Use the diagrams:** Reference architecture diagrams when making implementation decisions.
4. **Regular code reviews:** Review each major component against the specifications.

### Implementation Order Within Each Section
1. **Data models first:** Begin with implementing the data models.
2. **Repositories second:** Build the data access layer.
3. **Use cases third:** Implement business logic.
4. **ViewModels fourth:** Create presentation logic.
5. **UI components last:** Build the user interface components.

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Unit test repositories and use cases:** Focus testing on business logic.
2. **UI tests for critical flows:** Test the most important user journeys.
3. **Test role boundaries:** Verify permission enforcement.
4. **Test on multiple devices:** Ensure responsive layouts.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Permission complexity:** Start with simplified implementation before adding full complexity.
2. **Navigation state:** Be careful with preserving navigation state during role changes.
3. **CoreData relationships:** Test relationships thoroughly to avoid runtime issues.
4. **Offline sync conflicts:** Implement clear conflict resolution policies early.

## Decision Making Guide

When faced with implementation decisions, follow this hierarchy:

1. **User Experience:** Does this deliver the best experience for each role?
2. **Privacy & Security:** Does this properly protect sensitive information?
3. **Performance:** Will this perform well on older devices?
4. **Maintainability:** Is this approach sustainable as the app grows?
5. **Development Speed:** Can this be implemented efficiently?
