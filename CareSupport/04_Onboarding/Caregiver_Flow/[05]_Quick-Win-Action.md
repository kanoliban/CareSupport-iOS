# [05] Quick Win Action — Caregiver Flow
**Screen Title:** Let's Start With a Win

---

## 🧭 Purpose
To immediately demonstrate the app’s value by helping the caregiver complete a contextually relevant action based on their selected challenge. This moment serves as emotional reinforcement and practical orientation.

---

## 🧠 Logic
- Triggered after the user selects their primary challenge.
- System dynamically selects the relevant action module.
- Completion of the task sets a “Milestone Achieved” flag in user profile.

---

## 🧩 Input Logic (from previous step)
Challenge selected on screen `[04]_Select-Primary-Challenge.md` determines the content of this screen:

| Challenge Category         | Corresponding Quick Win Action                                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Medication Management      | "Add your first medication"                                     |
| Family Coordination        | "Invite someone to your care circle"                            |
| Appointments               | "Add an upcoming appointment for your loved one"                |
| Communication              | "Write your first update to share with your care circle"        |
| Something Else (free text) | "Customize your dashboard" (optional tips offered)              |

## 🖼️ UI Elements
- **Header:** “Let’s Start With a Win”
- **Subtext:** “We’ll help you tackle your biggest challenge—right now.”
