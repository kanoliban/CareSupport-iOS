# Supporter Care Plan Setup - Full Specifications

This document contains the complete production-ready specifications for the Supporter Care Plan Setup flow in the CareSupport iOS app. The Supporter flow is designed to be lightweight, emotionally intelligent, and respectful of boundaries, recognizing that Supporters are often extended family, neighbors, or friends who are willing to help but not looking to be overwhelmed.

## Overall Design Philosophy

The Supporter Care Plan Setup is:
- **4 steps total** (shorter than other roles)
- Emphasizing **opt-in**, **autonomy**, and **clarity**
- Capturing **task preferences**, **availability**, and **communication comfort**
- Avoiding overwhelming or assuming high involvement
- Ending with a clear preview of how they'll contribute

## Logic & Flow Notes

### Task Type Definitions
Each task category includes:
- Icon representation
- Brief description of what it entails
- Typical time commitment
- Examples of specific tasks

### Selection Behavior
- Multi-select allows any number of preferences
- At least one selection recommended before proceeding
- If no selections made but "Save" tapped, gentle suggestion appears
- "Other" selection reveals text field for custom support types

### Pre-Selection Logic
- If invited by Organizer with specific support needs mentioned, those categories subtly highlighted
- Based on care recipient needs, relevant categories may be emphasized

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "supporter_preferences": {
    "task_types": [
      {
        "type": "meals_groceries",
        "selected": true,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "transportation",
        "selected": true,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "social_checkins",
        "selected": false,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "errands",
        "selected": false,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "companionship",
        "selected": true,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "administrative",
        "selected": false,
        "custom_notes": ""
      },
      {
        "type": "other",
        "selected": false,
        "custom_notes": "Helping with gardening occasionally"
      }
    ],
    "updated_at": "2025-04-14T16:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Implementation Considerations
- Use native iOS card selection components
- Implement subtle visual feedback on selection/deselection
- Store partial selections if user navigates away
- Support offline selection with later sync
- Enable analytics to track most common support preferences

## Accessibility Considerations
- Task cards have clear ARIA roles and labels
- Selection state is both visually apparent and announced to screen readers
- Multi-select behavior clearly communicated
- All interactive elements have minimum 44x44px touch targets
- High contrast for selected/unselected states
- Voice input available for custom task description
- Support keyboard navigation through grid
- Focus management follows logical order

## Completion Flow
- **On Save**:
  - Visual confirmation of saved preferences
  - Subtle animation acknowledging selection
  - Automatic progression to next screen

- **On Skip**:
  - Toast notification: "We've set some default preferences you can update later"
  - System creates default preference set with "Social check-ins" enabled
  - Proceeds to next screen

## Final Notes
This screen empowers Supporters to define their contribution on their terms, reducing anxiety about overcommitment while still encouraging participation. The multi-select approach with clear descriptions helps Supporters identify where they can be most effective, creating better matches between needs and offers. The emphasis on being able to adjust preferences later reinforces flexibility and reduces pressure around initial selections.
