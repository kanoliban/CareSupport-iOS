**Last Updated:** 2025-04-14  
**Status:** Draft  
**Document Location:** `/06_Core_Platform/Role_Specific/Supporter/Supporter_Experience.md`

## 1. Overview

This document defines the complete Supporter Experience for CareSupport's unified platform. The Supporter role represents occasional helpers who provide specific assistance within the care circle but are not responsible for primary care coordination. The Supporter Experience is designed to facilitate meaningful contributions while respecting boundaries, creating a low-pressure environment that acknowledges and appreciates every contribution.

### 1.2 Purpose & Scope

This specification:
- Defines the complete user experience for the Supporter role
- Details the four core modules that comprise the Supporter experience
- Provides implementation guidance for developers, designers, and QA
- Establishes integration points with other system components
- Outlines testing requirements for all Supporter-related functionality

### 1.3 Supporter Role Context

Supporters are individuals who provide occasional, task-specific help to the care circle. Key characteristics include:

- **Relationship:** Often extended family members, friends, or neighbors
- **Commitment:** Limited, clearly bounded, occasional
- **Emotional Context:** Desire to help without overwhelming commitment
- **Primary Focus:** Specific contributions aligned with their availability and skills
- **Interface Need:** Simple, straightforward, low-friction experience

### 1.4 Design Philosophy

The Supporter Experience is built on five core principles:

1. **Low Pressure, High Impact:** Create an environment where even small contributions are meaningful
2. **Clear Boundaries:** Respect time constraints and limited commitment
3. **Appreciation-Centered:** Acknowledge and reinforce the value of every contribution
4. **Simplified Clarity:** Reduce complexity to focus on immediate tasks and needs
5. **Opt-In Engagement:** Everything beyond core functionality is optional and explicitly chosen

## 2. Experience Overview

The Supporter Experience centers around four interconnected modules that work together to create a cohesive, focused experience:

1. **Opportunity View:** The primary landing experience that presents ways to help based on availability and skills
2. **Availability Management:** Tools to communicate when and how the Supporter can assist
3. **Limited Care Updates:** A filtered view of relevant care circle information
4. **Support Action History:** Record of past contributions and their impact

These modules are sequenced and balanced to guide Supporters through a journey that begins with opportunity discovery, enables contribution on their terms, keeps them appropriately informed, and recognizes their impact.

### 2.1 User Journey Overview

The typical Supporter journey follows this pattern:

1. **Onboarding:** Simple introduction to role and boundaries
2. **Availability Setting:** Defining when and how they can help
3. **Opportunity Discovery:** Finding ways to contribute that match their availability
4. **Task Acceptance:** Opting into specific support tasks
5. **Task Completion:** Performing and recording assistance
6. **Acknowledgment:** Receiving appreciation and seeing impact
7. **Continuous Engagement:** Repeating on their terms and schedule

### 2.2 Interaction with Other Roles

| Role | Interaction Pattern | Primary Touchpoints |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Caregiver | Receives task assignments and updates | Task requests, Thank you messages |
| Organizer | Receives coordination requests and schedule information | Scheduling requests, Team updates |
| Care Recipient | Limited direct interaction, privacy-filtered | General updates, Direct thanks |

## 3. Core Modules

### 3.1 Opportunity View

#### 3.1.1 Purpose & Overview

The Opportunity View serves as the main landing experience for Supporters, presenting a personalized set of ways they can help based on their availability, skills, and the care circle's needs. It transforms abstract care needs into concrete, actionable opportunities that respect the Supporter's boundaries.

## 4. User Experience Integration

### 4.1 Role-Based Adaptations

The Supporter Experience implements role-based adaptations across all components:

| Component | Adaptation Approach | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Navigation | Simplified tab structure | Focus on My Opportunities, My Commitments, Updates, Profile |
| Task Cards | Reduced complexity | Show only essential information needed for task completion |
| Updates | Privacy-filtered | Only show circle-level information, no medical or intimate details |
| Action Buttons | Straightforward choices | Primary focus on accept/decline and complete actions |
| Notifications | Respectful boundaries | Honor quiet hours, limit to essential alerts |

### 4.2 Emotional Intelligence Implementation

The Supporter Experience embodies the Emotional Intelligence Constitution through:

| Principle | Implementation | Examples |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Care Before Management | Focus on human impact of contributions | "Your meal delivery brightened Elizabeth's day" vs "Task completed" |
| Invisible Understanding | Contextual suggestions based on patterns | "You've provided meals on Tuesdays before. Here's another opportunity." |
| Dignity Through Agency | Clear opt-in approach to all commitments | No auto-assignment, all support is explicitly accepted |
| Whole-Person Recognition | Appreciation that acknowledges the person, not just the task | Personalized thanks that recognize the specific nature of contributions |

**Emotional Intelligence in Communication:**
- **Tone:** Warm, appreciative, never presumptuous
- **Request Framing:** "Would you be able to help?" rather than "You should do this"
- **Feedback Style:** Specific appreciation rather than generic thanks
- **Pressure Avoidance:** Clear "It's okay to decline" messaging

### 4.3 Permission Framework Implementation

The Supporter Experience implements the Permission Framework with these key aspects:

**Core Permissions:**
- View assigned tasks and opportunities
- Accept/decline support requests
- Update own availability
- View circle-level updates (no health data)
- Provide task completion feedback

**Permission Boundaries:**
- No access to health information
- No visibility into medication details
- No access to care recipient's personal care information
- No ability to create tasks for others
- No ability to assign tasks to others

**Implementation Details:**
- All API requests validate permissions server-side
- UI proactively hides unauthorized actions
- Update feed filters based on privacy settings
- Error handling provides appropriate messages for denied actions

### 4.4 Navigation & Information Architecture

The Supporter Experience follows the platform's Information Architecture with role-specific adaptations:

**Primary Navigation:**
- **Home Tab:** Opportunity View (default landing page)
- **Care Tab:** My Commitments (accepted tasks) 
- **Connect Tab:** Limited Care Updates
- **Profile Tab:** Availability Management, Support History, Settings

**Secondary Navigation:**
- Home Tab sections: Available Opportunities, Suggested Opportunities
- Care Tab sections: Upcoming Commitments, Completed Support
- Connect Tab sections: Circle Updates, Appreciation
- Profile Tab sections: Availability Settings, Support History, Account Settings

**Information Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary Focus:** Current opportunities and commitments
2. **Secondary Focus:** Updates and appreciation
3. **Tertiary Focus:** History and statistics

### 4.5 Notification Strategy

The Supporter Experience implements a respectful notification strategy:

**Notification Types:**
- **Opportunity Alerts:** New matching opportunities
- **Task Reminders:** Upcoming committed tasks
- **Appreciation Alerts:** Thanks and feedback received
- **Milestone Celebrations:** Recognition of contribution landmarks

**Delivery Rules:**
- Honor quiet hours and channel preferences
- Bundle non-urgent notifications
- Allow granular control over notification types
- Default to minimal, essential notifications only

## 5. Technical Integration

### 5.1 Component Integration

The Supporter Experience integrates with these core platform components:

| Component | Integration Approach | Data Flow |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| Authentication System | Standard auth flow with role context | User authentication → role identification |
| Task Management System | Role-filtered task interactions | Tasks → opportunities → commitments |
| Communication Hub | Privacy-filtered update stream | Updates → filtered timeline |
| Notification System | Preference-aware notifications | Triggers → delivery rules → notifications |
| Care Circle Management | Limited member view | Member data → simplified directory |

### 5.2 State Management Implementation

State management for the Supporter Experience follows these patterns:

**Core State Slices:**
- Opportunities state (available and suggested)
- Commitments state (accepted and scheduled)
- Availability state (patterns and status)
- Updates state (filtered feed)
- History state (completed actions)

**State Transitions:**
```
Opportunity → Accept → Commitment → Complete → History
```

**Persistence Strategy:**
- Opportunities: Session storage with refresh
- Commitments: Local storage with sync
- Availability: Server-side with local cache
- Updates: Session storage with cache invalidation
- History: Server-side with pagination

### 5.3 Performance Considerations

**Key Performance Requirements:**
- Opportunity feed initial load under 2 seconds
- Opportunity filtering under 500ms
- Task acceptance confirmation under 1 second
- Update feed scrolling at 60fps

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Virtualized lists for long scrolling areas
- Pagination for history and updates
- Preloading of likely opportunities
- Background refresh of non-critical data

### 5.4 Offline Capabilities

The Supporter Experience implements these offline capabilities:

| Feature | Offline Support | Implementation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Opportunity Browsing | Cached view | Store recent opportunities locally |
| Availability Management | Full offline editing | Queue changes for sync |
| Task Completion | Offline recording | Store completion data for upload |
| Update Viewing | Cached content | Store recent updates for offline reading |

**Sync Resolution Strategy:**
- Opportunity acceptance requires connectivity
- Availability changes sync when connection restored
- Task completion syncs with conflict resolution
- Update reactions queue for delivery
