## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

CareSupport is an emotionally intelligent platform designed to connect caregivers, care recipients, organizers, and supporters in a coordinated care experience. The iOS application serves as the primary interface for users across all roles, adapting its functionality, content, and permissions based on the user's role while maintaining a consistent design system and interaction patterns.

The platform addresses the significant challenges faced in caregiving scenarios by providing:

- **Role-specific experiences** within a unified application
- **Emotionally intelligent interactions** that acknowledge the human aspect of caregiving
- **Coordinated care management** tools for different stakeholders
- **Privacy-preserving information sharing** that respects boundaries

### 1.2 Core Platform Concept

CareSupport's unified platform approach means:

- All roles share the same component system and layout framework
- Content, functionality, and permissions adapt based on role
- The "Care Circle" serves as the central organizing entity
- Interactions maintain consistency while respecting role-specific needs

### 1.3 User Roles

The platform supports four primary user roles:

| Role | Primary Responsibilities | Key Features |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Caregiver** | Provides direct care and coordination | Task management, health tracking, care planning |
| **Care Recipient** | Receives care and provides preferences | Needs expression, privacy controls, daily planning |
| **Organizer** | Manages logistics and schedules | Team coordination, scheduling, task assignment |
| **Supporter** | Provides occasional assistance | Task completion, availability management |

### 1.4 Business Goals

1. Create a unified platform that serves all roles in the caregiving ecosystem
2. Reduce caregiver burnout through coordinated support and emotional intelligence
3. Empower care recipients with appropriate autonomy and privacy controls
4. Facilitate effective communication and task distribution among care teams
5. Build an adaptable platform that scales with changing care needs

## 2. Architecture Recommendations

### 2.1 Architectural Pattern

We recommend implementing a **Clean Architecture** pattern with MVVM presentation layer:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Presentation Layer                 │
│  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │    Views    │◄─►│  ViewModels │◄─►│ Coordinators│  │
│  └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘  │
└───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                            │
┌───────────────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│                     Domain Layer                      │
│  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │   Use Cases │◄─►│   Entities  │   │ Repositories│  │
│  └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────┬───────┘  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┘
                                            │
┌───────────────────────────────────────────▼───────────┐
│                     Data Layer                        │
│  ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │API Services │   │Local Storage│   │ Data Models │  │
│  └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 State Management

Implement a layered state management approach:

1. **Application State**: Global, cross-cutting concerns (auth, preferences)
2. **Role Context**: Role-specific adaptations (active role, permissions)
3. **Entity State**: Domain data (tasks, events, health data)
4. **View State**: Current UI state (active views, transient UI)
5. **Session State**: Temporary user session data (navigation, unsaved changes)

We recommend using a combination of:
- Swift Combine framework for reactive state management
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Coordinator pattern for navigation management

### 2.3 Authentication & Authorization

Implement a JWT-based authentication system with:
- Support for multiple authentication methods (email/password, social)
- Refresh token mechanism for session management
- Secure token storage using iOS Keychain
- Role context switching within authenticated sessions

### 2.4 Data Persistence

Implement a multi-layered persistence strategy:
- CoreData for complex relational data and offline support
- UserDefaults for user preferences and simple settings
- Keychain for secure credential storage
- Synchronization layer for server consistency

### 2.5 Component Architecture

Create a modular component system with:
- Feature modules organized by domain
- Shared design component library
- Role-adaptive UI components
- Permission-aware views

## 3. Key User Flows

### 3.1 Onboarding Flows

All users begin with role declaration and then follow role-specific onboarding paths:

**Caregiver Onboarding**:
1. Define relationship to care recipient
2. Identify care recipient
3. Describe care situation
4. Select primary challenges
5. Identify quick-win actions
6. Invite care recipient (optional)
7. Add support circle members
8. Review privacy and permissions
9. Receive emotional framing

**Care Recipient Onboarding**:
1. Confirm invitation
2. Set privacy preferences
3. Express needs and preferences
4. Review today's plan
5. Confirm consent
6. Receive emotional support

**Organizer & Supporter** flows follow similar patterns with role-specific adjustments.

### 3.2 Care Plan Setup

After onboarding, each role completes a care plan setup:

**Caregiver**:
1. Establish starting point
2. Set up quick-win tasks
3. Define daily rhythm
4. Configure circle involvement

**Care Recipient**:
1. Define ideal day structure
2. Set communication style preferences
3. Specify help preferences
4. Set up journal

**Organizer**:
1. Review care team
2. Set up task assignments
3. Create master schedule
4. Establish communication protocols

### 3.3 Core Platform Flows

**Task Management**:
1. Task creation and assignment
2. Task acceptance and completion
3. Recurring task management
4. Task notification and reminders

**Communication Hub**:
1. Direct messaging
2. Care circle updates
3. Status sharing
4. Need expression

**Care Coordination**:
1. Calendar and scheduling
2. Health event tracking
3. Resource sharing
4. Cross-role coordination

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 API Integration

The application will communicate with a RESTful API:

- Base URL: `https://api.caresupport.com/v1/{resource}`
- Authentication: JWT tokens via authorization headers
- Role Context: Custom role context header (`X-Role-Context`)
- Response Format: Standardized JSON envelope structure

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response payload
  },
  "meta": {
    "server_timestamp": "2025-04-14T15:30:05Z",
    "request_id": "req123456",
    "status": "success",
    "pagination": {
      "total": 100,
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 20,
      "next_page": 2
    }
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### 4.2 Data Models

Key data model entities include:

**User**:
- Supports multiple roles
- Maintains role-specific preferences

2. **Attribute-Based Adjustments**: Context-sensitive permissions
3. **Relationship-Based Access**: Permissions based on connection to care recipient
4. **Object-Level Permissions**: Fine-grained control at the data object level
5. **User Consent Overrides**: Care recipient controls that override defaults

Permission evaluation follows a specific sequence:
1. Check system-level restrictions
2. Apply role-based default permissions
3. Apply relationship context modifiers
4. Check object-level permissions
5. Apply any user overrides

### 4.4 iOS Platform Requirements
