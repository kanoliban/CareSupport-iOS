### ✅ [04] Today’s Plan Preview

**Screen Title**: Here's What Today Looks Like

---

### 🎯 Purpose  
To give care recipients a sense of clarity and control by previewing what they can expect today in terms of care and interaction.

---

### 🧠 Philosophy  
Reducing ambiguity reduces anxiety. This reinforces orientation and lowers cognitive load.

---

### 📲 UI Components  
- Sample preview of:  
  - Medication reminders  
  - Appointments  
  - Messages from caregivers  
  - Any scheduled visits

- Note: “This view updates automatically each morning.”

---

### 🔄 Logic  
- Pulls simulated data (if first-time user)  
- Replaces with real data upon live use

---

### ⚙️ Technical Notes  
- Should reflect real-time sync with Caregiver input once setup is complete  
- First-time view uses onboarding mock state
