## Final Notes  
This final screen is not a “thank you,” it’s a **mirror**—a quiet moment to reflect what the care recipient has built. It bridges the care recipient’s voice, their preferences, and their emotional labor into the space where the app can now act on their behalf.  

The goal is to leave the user with a sense of **clarity, control, and comfort**—and then gently invite them to step into the rhythm of real care coordination through their new dashboard.
