# Screen [09] – Emotional Framing / Dashboard Intro

## 🧠 Purpose
To emotionally transition the user from onboarding to ongoing engagement. This screen serves as the "closing scene" of the onboarding, reinforcing their impact, reducing overwhelm, and inviting them into daily use with confidence.

---

## 🖥️ Screen Elements

- **Header**: “You’ve built your support circle.”
- **Subtext**: “Your care system is now connected, supported, and ready.”
- **Emotional Message Box**:
  > _Welcome to CareSupport. We’re with you now._

- **Primary CTA Button**: “Go to Dashboard”
- **Secondary CTA (small)**: “Edit My Circle”

---

## 🔄 Logic

- Reached only after completing the previous onboarding steps
- If the user skipped any optional actions (e.g., invite), system displays gentle nudge: “You can invite others later from your dashboard”
- User state is saved and marked as “onboarded” upon pressing “Go to Dashboard”

## 📥 Data Captured

- Timestamp of onboarding completion
- Whether quick win was completed
- Whether care circle was established or skipped
- User emotional score if collected earlier (future phase)
