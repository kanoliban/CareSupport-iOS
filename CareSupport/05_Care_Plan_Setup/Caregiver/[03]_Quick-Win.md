## Screen Title
Your First Win

Caregiver

## Purpose
To give caregivers an immediate sense of momentum and relief by helping them complete a meaningful action aligned with their most pressing challenge. This sets the tone for productive use of CareSupport by reducing cognitive load and fostering early success.

## UI Components

## üìç Transition Behavior

- **Comes After**: `[02]_Starting-Point.md` (challenge selected or confirmed)
- **Leads To**: `[04]_Daily-Rhythm.md`
- **Alternative Path**: If user taps "Skip for now," a system flag is set and a Dashboard reminder is created
- **Data Continuity**:
  - Pulls from: `primary_challenge` selected in onboarding or `[02]_Starting-Point.md`
  - Outputs: Completed Quick Win task (saved and displayed in dashboard)

## Primary Actions
- **Primary CTA**: "Add Task" or contextual variant (e.g., "Add Medication", "Assign Visit")
- **Secondary CTA**: "Skip for now (You can come back anytime)"
- **Tertiary Action**: "Share with Care Circle" (collaborative option)

**Post-Completion Suggestion**:
- "Great job! Would you like to add another task for someone else in the circle?"

## Emotional Framing

- **Challenge-Specific Headers**:
  - Medication: "Let's get medication organized‚Äîit's a foundation of good care"
  - Appointments: "Planning ahead reduces stress for everyone involved"
  - Tasks: "Small steps add up to meaningful support"
  - Communication: "Keeping everyone informed creates peace of mind"

  - Example: "Consistent medication tracking reduces errors and worry"

- **Testimonial Encouragement**:
  - "Other caregivers found that starting with medication management reduced their stress by creating clear routines"
  - "Caregivers like you report that having even one scheduled task makes the day feel more manageable"

- **Acknowledgment**: "You told us [challenge] matters most. Let's handle it first."

- **Encouragement**: Tailored to challenge type rather than generic messaging
  - Medication: "Organizing medications creates safety and peace of mind"
  - Tasks: "Delegating even one task creates breathing room in your day"
  - Appointments: "Planning ahead means less last-minute stress"

- **Skip Logic**: "You can skip and come back later. This is your space, your pace."

## Final Notes

This screen anchors the Care Plan Setup with a real, visible task. The action taken here sets the tone for follow-through, and offers a strong moment of self-efficacy. Templates and defaults reduce friction while voice input gives space for depth. The collaborative options and next-step suggestions create momentum that extends beyond this single screen, reinforcing that caregiving is a team effort from the beginning.
