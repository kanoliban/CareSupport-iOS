# CareSupport Unified Platform: Product Development Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-14  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Product Lead  
**Document Location:** `/01_Product_Strategy/Development_Plan.md`

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for CareSupport's unified platform – the core application experience that follows onboarding and care plan setup. This plan uses a flexible, phase-based approach with clear milestones and deliverables, allowing for adaptation as we learn from implementation.

## 2. Development Principles

1. **Role-Adaptive, Not Role-Specific** - Build one system that adapts to user roles
2. **Emotional Intelligence** - Maintain emotional awareness throughout the interface
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show what's needed when it's needed
4. **Accessibility First** - Design for all users from the beginning
5. **Data Continuity** - Leverage data from onboarding and setup
6. **Iterative Development** - Build, test, learn, improve
